# Stardrive BlackBox
This is the 15b version of StarDrive.exe originally decompiled from CIL and almost completely rewritten by the BlackBox team.
The current release is **BlackBox - Jupiter (1.60)** and the upcoming version is **BlackBox - Saturn**.

Notice: We have StarDrive developer's [publicly and privately stated approval](http://steamcommunity.com/app/252450/discussions/0/385428458177062745/#c365163686048069513) for modifying the game for educational purposes but this software is still under the steam license restrictions.
Do not use this for immoral or personal financial gain, donation requests are ok but can not be demanded or required.
Do not attempt to circumvent game DRM. Be reasonably respectful of the dev and the original software and steam.

# System Requirements

* **OS**: Windows 10 version 1803+ / Windows 11 (x64) — community default  
  **Fork builds**: macOS Apple Silicon (DesktopVK / MoltenVK) — see [docs/macos-arm64.md](docs/macos-arm64.md)
* **Architecture**: 64-bit
* **.NET runtime**: bundled with the installer (.NET 8)

# Downloads

The canonical distribution channel is **itch.io**:

* **[Jupiter 1.60 on itch.io](https://stardriveteam.itch.io/jupiter-160)** — major installer (~690 MB, bundles the .NET 8 runtime and ships the Combined Arms mod alongside the game)

Major versions are big, 600-700 MB installs. Patches are relatively small and are always cumulative — install the major version, then the game's in-app updater picks up the latest patch on first launch. Hover the prompt to see the changelog.

[Per-patch artefacts](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/StarDrive/releases) are also published as GitHub Releases for reference; the canonical first-time install path remains itch.io.

# Mods
The mods currently supported on BlackBox are:
* [Combined Arms](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/CombinedArms) — a huge content mod. Jupiter 1.60 compatible.
* [Star Trek: Shattered Alliance](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/StarTrekShatteredAlliance) — vanilla races plus Star Trek races and ships.

# Community

# BlackBox - Jupiter (current)
What Jupiter 1.60 delivers, building on the Mars line:
* **64-bit engine** — the 32-bit ~2 GB process ceiling is gone; late-game crashes with large empires or Combined Arms are fixed
* **MonoGame 3.8 renderer** replaces the discontinued XNA + SunBurn stack; no more XNA 3.1 redistributable requirement
* **.NET 8 runtime** bundled with the installer (was .NET Framework 4.8)
* Restored visual effects, skinned/animated meshes, material maps, post-process passes, basic shadow maps
* Save format partitioned (`SaveGameVersion = 21`) so Jupiter coexists side-by-side with a Mars 1.51 install

# BlackBox - Mars (legacy)
What the Mars line delivered (1.50 / 1.51), now preserved on the [`mars-1.51`](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/StarDrive/tree/mars-1.51) branch for back-port hotfixes:
* Huge performance improvements
* Huge stability improvements - especially got rid of most OutOfMemory errors
* Racial planet preferences
* Research Stations
* Mining Ops
* Multi Level Research for bonuses/upgrades
* New mesh, texture and shader loading system
* Auto Update for BlackBox versions and mods

# How do I get set up for Development?

* Install [Visual Studio 2022 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
    * Workloads Module: `.NET desktop development` with **.NET 8 SDK**
    * Workloads Module: `Desktop development with C++` with `MSVC v143`
    * Workloads Module: `Game development with C++` with `Windows 10 SDK`
* Install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or some other GIT client.
    * Configure SourceTree: Tools->Options->Git: [v] Perform submodule actions recursively _(Important!!!)_
* [Clone](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/clone-a-repository-into-sourcetree-780870050.html) this repository to a local directory, for example: C:/Projects/BlackBox
    * Advanced Options When cloning: [v] Recurse submodules _(Important!!!)_
* The active development branch is `main` (post-migration Jupiter line). The Mars-line legacy branch is `mars-1.51`.
* **macOS Apple Silicon (this fork):** checkout `macos-arm64` and run `bash scripts/macos-dev-setup.sh` — see [docs/macos-arm64.md](docs/macos-arm64.md).
* Launch Visual Studio, any required DLL references should be in `BlackBox/game` directory.
* Launch a full build (Build -> Build Solution) in `Release|x64` configuration to produce the BlackBox StarDrive executable.
    * If you get this build error: "Windows 10 SDK is not installed", then you need to go back to Visual Studio installer and enable Desktop development with C++
    * If you get this build error: ".. Cannot open include file: 'corecrt.h': No such file or directory ..", then you are also missing Desktop development with C++

* Install [JetBrains ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/) to enjoy enhanced refactoring capabilities.
* Please NOTE: if the **default** Release and Debug configurations *do not work* for you then your setup is incorrect. Contact us in Discord #general-discussion.

### Contribution Guidelines

* Utilize Discord for chat discussions on ideas and refactoring.
* Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TeamStarDrive/StarDrive/issues) to propose new ideas.
* Creating feature branches is always allowed and Pull Requests will be reviewed by the team.
* Comment your code so people can see what you are changing. Non-documented code will not pass review.
* Write clean code, following current best software practices. #DRY #CleanCode

### Who do I talk to?

* In Discord: @RedFox and @Fat_Bastard can provide guidance of this codebase.
* If you have a bug report, post an issue or post a bug in our Discord channel.
* For other feature ideas, you can join our Discord chat and talk with the team!

# Modding
BlackBox has greatly improved modding capabilities over the original game,
contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dfvnfH4) for more information on modding.

## What is moddable?
* Globals.yaml provides access to all global game settings, more detailed than previously available.
* All textures can be replaced, PNG and DDS are supported. The old XNB textures are no longer recommended.
* All meshes can be replaced, we support OBJ and FBX meshes.
* Audio can be modded
* Custom stars
* Custom planets
* Some UI layouts can be modded, mostly MainMenu for now
* All YAML files can be modded and are hotloaded while the game is running, so you can do interactive tweaking
* Feel free to ask for more details in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dfvnfH4)

# Development Cycle
## For new features, refactors, old bug fixes  (feature)
* Create a new feature branch from `main`.
* Always add NEW feature unit tests and playtest your changes.
* Create a pull request and wait for review. Be ready to make a few tweaks! It is easy to create unintentional bugs in this legacy codebase.
## If bugs are found in main branch (hotfix)
* Create an issue or mark existing issue as a "Blocker" for current release.
* Post the issue in the dev channel of discord.
* If you can quickly fix it, help us by creating a hotfix pull request.

# Command Line Arguments
BlackBox provides a CLI for running certain utilities from Command Prompt.
Many of these are developer oriented and not very useful for regular users.
